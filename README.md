Bootstrapwp - TWITTER BOOTSTRAP for WordPress
=================

Bootstrap is a responsive front-end toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart web development, complete with core HTML, CSS, and JS for grids, type, forms, navigation, and many more components. Now you can use it with **WordPress** as a solid base to build custom themes quickly and easily.

For the most up-to-date version, follow the in-process development branch: [https://github.com/rachelbaker/bootstrapwp-Twitter-Bootstrap-for-WordPress/tree/1-WIP](https://github.com/rachelbaker/bootstrapwp-Twitter-Bootstrap-for-WordPress/tree/1-WIP)

##Version .86 of BootstrapWP â€“ Released April 11, 2012

**This release resolves a few major bugs and keeps the theme moving forward along with the progress of Twitter Bootstrap.**

The major changes are:

1. Removed the buggy catch_that_image function that was displaying thumbnails for posts, and replacing it with the new bootstrapwp_autoset_featured_image()` function that will automatically set the post thumbnail.
2. Fixed navbar on mobile devices where body padding was causing the navbar to drop below the the top of the window.
3. Revised order of stylesheets loading
4. Corrected the broken favicon links
